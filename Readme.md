# Stable Diffusion Image Generation

This project demonstrates how to use the Stable Diffusion model for generating images based on text prompts. The code uses PyTorch and Hugging Face's diffusers library for model loading and image generation. The project runs efficiently on Google Colab or other environments with GPU support.
